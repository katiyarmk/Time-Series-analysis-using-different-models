# Time-Series-analysis-using-different-models
In this project, I have converted daily stream flow data of Smith river in to the monthly streamflow data. This monthly time series is modelled using AR(1), MA(1), ARMA(1,1) models and based on results , model performance is analysed. Then we have generated 100 year sequence of strem flow time series using different models. This is very useful in designing water utility infrastructures. 
AT last, I have used precipitation data of kanpur city and modelled it for dry and wet periods for the months of June, July, August and September. Then I generated 1000 day sequence of dry and wet days for each month and then compared the observed and modelled longest dry and wet spells for each month. This helps in predicting the unforseen situations and accordingly desingn water supply infrastructures.
